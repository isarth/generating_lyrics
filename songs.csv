So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking faster and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you





One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i

I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i

1,"When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill





Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

You know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we shouldn't had asked but

How would you feel

It's just something that I want to do
I'm taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too





In the summer, as the lilacs blew
Blood flows deeper than a river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon

3,"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same





'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now

Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms

I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side, as this skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wonder do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see, the way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead, into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing ""Chasing Cars"" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were laying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through London's streets and knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
Hear the song our heart is beating to?





So open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead into the night with me

7,"Well, get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both [?] upon the waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Please don't close until we wanna leave it

You and I
We’re flying on an aeroplane tonight
We’re going somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let’s pretend in the streets of Barcelona
Barcelona!
Barcelona!
Barcelona!

We’ll get up up on the dance floor moves
It’s Saturday night, I fell in love with the sparkle and the moonlight reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny making it right
And just like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around ,e again and again
You’re like something that God has sent me
I want you baby SOLAMENTE





You and I
We’re flying on an aeroplane tonight
We’re going somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let’s pretend to dance in the streets of Barcelona
Barcelona!
Barcelona!
Barcelona!

So let’s pretend in the streets of Barcelona
Las ramblas, I’ll meet you dancing around la sagrada
Drinking sangria
Mi niña, te amo
Mamacita, rica, te adoro señorita
Nosotros vive la vida
Como es vivir en barcelona
Las ramblas, I’ll meet you
Come on and dance with me in barcelona
Drinking sangria
I just want to be in barcelona
Mamacita, rica, feel that summer breeze in barcelona

Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I’ve been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded
How'd I get so faded
Oh
No no don’t leave me lonely now
If you love me how
You'll never learn
Ooh
Color crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream

Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

I’ve been looking for a love
Thought I’d find her in a bottle
God make me another one
I’ll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I’ve done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon her, Broken hearted lover
Oh
No no don’t leave me lonely now
If you love me how
You'll never learn
Ooh
Color crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream





Fading out again
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in

So tell me when it kicks in

Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

Calling out across the line

Ah-la-la-la-la
I met this girl late last year
She said don’t you worry if I disappear
I told her I’m not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We’ll be in between the sheets until the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should’ve just said
She’s singing
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don’t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don’t wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don’t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don’t wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she’s staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I don’t want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what it’s about
But maybe we’ll go together and just figure it out
I’d rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we’ll be missing it now
Wish I’d have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How? I was confused about
She should figure it out while I’m sat here singing
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don’t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don’t wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don’t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don’t wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don’t even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn’t need to take him to bed that’s all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It’s not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn’t looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It’s a bit too much, too late if I’m honest
All this time God knows I’m singing
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don’t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don’t wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don’t fuck with my love

Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong

And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

11,"I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all.
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love





I wanna hold your heart in both hands
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to.

There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore.

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
We'll applaud you with the sound that my hands make.

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love.

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change

12,"I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
They showed me the locked doors I find another use of key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow





I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am not beyond my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain

And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner
I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngling
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away

Singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I wish my family and friends they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh
And I wish I'd never run to
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, ""Fuck you""
I wish I was home more
I wish my teens could see the kids on the birthdays, but yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grow more, wish I told more
People that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for
And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?
Oh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressin' 'cause
Every day this shit gets the best of us
Usin' my balance on eraser blades
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait

Singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat cold
Mum sayin', ""Don't smoke,"" no, I don't listen, I got
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign
Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine
Shit, quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick, with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me work hard and you can never be shit
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Set back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had
One wish",Eraser,https://www.directlyrics.com/ed-sheeran-eraser-lyrics.html,"[[ 0.15473437 -0.19478141 -0.0592219  -0.00289775 -0.25127625 -0.12709281

Even my dad does sometimes
So don’t wipe your eyes

It’s alright to die
Cause death's the only thing you haven’t tried
But just for tonight hold on

So live life like you’re giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It’s alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage Against the dying of the light
It’s alright to say that death’s the only thing you haven’t tried

I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you've found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight
I wish I never called you up
Nobody told me
And they don't know, they don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
Won't you just hold me tonight
And I would stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not, anything like a voice
Cause you were the only one for me

Cause maybe I don't want to lose a lover and friend in one night

[Hidden track ""The Parting Glass""]

Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all",Give Me Love,https://www.directlyrics.com/ed-sheeran-give-me-love-lyrics.html,"[[-0.00528661 -0.11590523 -0.00233627  0.03329714 -0.11828084 -0.05672994

But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said baby I just want to dance

I saw her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as a shotgun
Chilled some more one more drink at the bar
Then say I'm on the jukebox, got to dance, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said baby I just want to dance
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl





You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sing so sweet
A capella in the bar wring her feet for the beat
Oh, I could have that while playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said baby I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to pot you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said baby I just want to dance

You know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we shouldn't had asked but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'm taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too





In the summer, as the lilacs blew
Blood flows deeper than a river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'm taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you

I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier

Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new





'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'd feel it too
I know I could smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's son

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky





Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

Oh, should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze

Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I can’t work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though I've known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But you’re my road walking me home
Home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I’m a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can’t shake this feeling now
We’re going through the motions
Hoping you'd stop
And though I’ve only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With all this beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When you’re my road walking me home
Home, home, home





See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I’m a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
Even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
I'm just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain

And the seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hotter
And the hunger more profound
Well I know there can come tears from their eyes
But they may as well be in vain
Even though
I know these tears bring me pain
Even so
I'm just the same





Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain (x8)

And the seas are full of water
That stop by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
That never reach the port

So let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let the lightning be the veins
And fill the sky
With all that they can drop

26,"I was twenty-four years old when I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty two grand kids now growing old in that house that your brother bought ya
Oh the summer day when I proposed, I made that wedding ring from [?] gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No, you won't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the wexford border

Will I met her at [Guy's?] in the second world war
She was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The second that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters





She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the wexford border

From her snow white in her [?] and jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
That's the difference, I  assure ya

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran

27,"I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play the guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers play
I’ll be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites, we needed no breathe
We used each others edge just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And also you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way God made us
And time’s the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home
Nina, oh, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that’s you and me both
Nina, oh, won’t you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You’d be wearing my hoodie
With draw strings pulled tight
To keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we be on the road
Cause every day when I was away
We'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish
Back to the borrow with all the Celtics
I disappear
You call me selfish, I understand
But I can’t help it
I put my job over everything
Except my family and friends
But you’ll be in between forever
So I guess we’ll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I’m not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we kinda need to deal with the pain
Or wait to get on the plane
But in the day we’ll have to say it again





Oh Nina
You should go Nina
‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home
Nina, oh, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that’s you and me both
Nina, oh, won’t you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won’t you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, oh oh won’t you leave me now

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
‘Cause I ain’t ever coming home
Nina, oh, won’t you leave me now
And I’ve been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina

28,"No, no, no, no, no

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears both shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet at watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Louis Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to me
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me





Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says, ""Cheya!"", boy never light up the room
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisp, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you, 'cause oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to me
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man

To carry love, to carry children of our own

Disappearing all night
I don’t wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do I wanna runaway
Runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go

How long you leaving?
Well dad just don’t expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It’s been a long day
Thumb on side of the roadway

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don’t wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I’ll just runaway and be on my own.

Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet.
And this is what I’m gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it’s morning, go

How long you leaving?
Well dad just don’t expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It’s been a long day
Thumb on side of the roadway

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don’t wanna live in his home.
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I’ll just runaway and be on my own.

Back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn’t down with that plan to attack intends to show love.
I don’t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
Could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us are saints
And I guess that God knows that
I don’t wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces, and hope that
Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don’t wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I’ll just runaway and be on my own.",Runaway,https://www.directlyrics.com/ed-sheeran-runaway-lyrics.html,"[[ 0.15495819 -0.21302593 -0.06166096 -0.00897087 -0.24863717 -0.11958455

You'll me in my arms

Cause they will tell you apart from the sins

Glass on the side I’ve
Been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don’t wanna know
If you’re getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man’s land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling, come on set the tone
If you feel you’re falling, won’t you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing

This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local rave
I don’t really know what I’m supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said it’s nice to meet ya
And then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she’s a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I’m in deep
If anybody finds out I’m meant to drive home
But I drunk all of it now, no
Sobering up
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another
Now she’s kissing my mouth

I need you darling, Come on set the tone
If you feel you’re falling, Won’t you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don’t even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the band
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

I need you darling

Won’t you let me know

I gave many my money and now we don't even speak
I drive miles and miles but would you do the same for me

Offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon 
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a wing
Its goes on and on and on

I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf, my farewell

'Cause human beings are destined to [?] or drink
What time do we stand upon come have it looks the same?

Just because they ended being just like that
Oh, I'm here again between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's hust of nature

'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song, but it helps

I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger been down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
You're home





I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
You're home
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I'll know that

Tell the driver make the radio play

At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Cafe clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight

I drill you deep into my chest
That’s where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
‘cause I don’t want to be alone

‘cause everyday that I’m breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs

Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But we’re only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes

With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue,

And if I blink again
You’ll be sinking in
So we’ll learn to swim in the ocean
You made to hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you’ll be floating away
And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of this sinking boat, now

I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves

These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves

Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes,your eyes

On my lips from your kiss bitterness
And I drown within the ocean you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs cover in your make up
I’ll never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of this sinking boat, now

I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact design
I’m on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I’m drowning in the ocean you made

You might be left with my hair, but you'll have your mother's eyes,
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can, but for now your scan of my unmade plans,
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life

I'll whisper quietly, and give you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
Oh, you are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
And you'll be alright.





You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin.
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin.
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice,
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes.

And I'll hold you tightly, and give you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
Oh, you are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
And you'll be alright.

You can lie with me,
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep,
I'll leave you be.
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe.

'Cause you are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
You are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
And you'll be alright.

And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same





'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now

Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

That maybe we found love right where we are

Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Cool girl, no phone

43,"I'm not a rapper
I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten,
Because plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm,
Prisoner with a vision

Signed to a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio with a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you
Over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now, and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter

For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and
I choked
And we've been sleeping at the subway station, sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't want to relax
But would it hurt your reputation,
If I put it on wax?
I take it back now





[chorus]
Come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

Take it back with the rhythm and blues
And my back pack I'll be singing the news,
Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring him to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop,
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes,
I give you the truth through the vocal booth,
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit,
They try and take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot,
But then again that's what they're supposed to do,
And I'm supposed to be calm,
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm, whispering everything that happens is from now on,
I'll be ready to start it again at the end of the song,
Still they claiming that I handled it wrong,
But then I never had an enemy, except for NME,
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be,
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees,
Are healthier than a dalmatian with pedigree
Singing for the masses,
Rubber dinghy rapids,
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on fashioning magic,
I'm battling with respect,
I don't know if I'll have it,
This songs from the heart,
Covering the planet,
I'll take it back now

[chorus]
Come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

Take it back now
Now, I don't ever want to be perfect,
Cause I'm a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
I accept the fact that someone's got to win the worst-dressed,
Taking my first steps into the scene,
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change,
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly,
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again,
Living life on the edge,
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
Might seem totally impossible
Achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely,
You'll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we plan it out;
It's time to take it back now

[chorus]
Come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

Come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, and lies, deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold woah
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage
Of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that posties
Little sister has to babysit, that's just a way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path

45,"Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But f- it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not

[Hook]
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with





I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no

46,"Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions or other people's quotes""

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat
And away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree
But lord knows everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the star monkey crashing in their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment





The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fitten' in your jeans
It's love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat
And away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree
But lord knows everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the star monkey crashing in their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can alle be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat
And away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree
But lord knows everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the star monkey crashing in their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
